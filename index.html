            This is a simple website show casing the features of the clock I designed during my partipation
            during the Hardware Product Sprint program by Google. <br>
            Below is a short explaination of the features! <br>
            Fun fact: This website was originally created to test out the display features for my clock before wiring
            everything up and working it out in C++.

                        Seconds (0-59) are shown as a 6 bit number !

                    This is the simple napkin sketch that started it all! <br>
                    The oringal idea was to use a few 7 Seg Displays to show the time. <br>
                    The LCD module and Rotary Encoder were always apart of the plan. <br>
                    I also thought of sensor for temperature but decided against it.
                </p>
                <p id="opt1">
                    This is the first block design of my block! <br>
                    Planning out how the parts in my clock would be linked together! <br>
                    Version 2 looks a bit different!
                </p>
                <p id="opt2">
                    This is the Human-Machine Interface (Version 1) of my Clock! <br>
                    I originally planned to have two inputs, one for changine time and date as well as one changing the
                    temp
                    mode to Cº to Fº <br>
                    3 Seven Segement displays were originally the idea.
                </p>
                <p id="opt3">
                    This is the Second version of my Block diagram <br>
                    As you can see I removed the Seven segement displays in favor for two 8x8 displays! <br>
                    I've abstracted the ICs that would control this such as the MAX7219 or the RTC IC.

                    This is the Second verison of my HMI <br>
                    As you can see it looks pretty familar at this point !
